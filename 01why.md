## Why Visualize?

> A picture is worth a thousand words.

The above quote is an easy answer to that question. Perhaps you wonder
whether any more need to be said besides those words. A visualization
summaries in a neat little picture many aspects of data that is difficult
to describe.

Take the below four data sets, for example.

|   x1 |    y1 | |   x2 |    y2 | |   x3 |    y3 | |   x4 |    y4 | 
|-----:|------:|-|-----:|------:|-|-----:|------:|-|-----:|------:|
| 10.0 |  8.04 | | 10.0 |  9.14 | | 10.0 |  7.46 | |  8.0 |  6.58 |
|  8.0 |  6.95 | |  8.0 |  8.14 | |  8.0 |  6.77 | |  8.0 |  5.76 |
| 13.0 |  7.58 | | 13.0 |  8.74 | | 13.0 | 12.74 | |  8.0 |  7.71 |
|  9.0 |  8.81 | |  9.0 |  8.77 | |  9.0 |  7.11 | |  8.0 |  8.84 |
| 11.0 |  8.33 | | 11.0 |  9.26 | | 11.0 |  7.81 | |  8.0 |  8.47 |
| 14.0 |  9.96 | | 14.0 |  8.10 | | 14.0 |  8.84 | |  8.0 |  7.04 |
|  6.0 |  7.24 | |  6.0 |  6.13 | |  6.0 |  6.08 | |  8.0 |  5.25 |
|  4.0 |  4.26 | |  4.0 |  3.10 | |  4.0 |  5.39 | | 19.0 | 12.50 |
| 12.0 | 10.84 | | 12.0 |  9.13 | | 12.0 |  8.15 | |  8.0 |  5.56 |
|  7.0 |  4.82 | |  7.0 |  7.26 | |  7.0 |  6.42 | |  8.0 |  7.91 |
|  5.0 |  5.68 | |  5.0 |  4.74 | |  5.0 |  5.73 | |  8.0 |  6.89 |

Do you see any difference between the four?




Many tasks have been made efficient by both increased computing power and
ubiquitious digital displays. Yet the production and consumption of data
visualizations are likely not to come to mind. 



Nevertheless, the growing ubiquity of visualizations
speaks to the enormous power in communicating complex information in graphical
form -- now that we are able to easily do so.

To be fair, this is hardly a surprise. A picture is worth a thousand words.

There are many reasons to visualize data. They typically fall under three categories:

- [Exploration](#explore): to explore an unfamiliar data set
- [Explanation](#explain): to explain main insights from a data set,
  to tell stories, to convince someone of something
- [Generating Interest](#attention): to cause someone to be interested in a topic

The first is typically done by data analyst, data scientists, or others who work
with data in order to produce insights or explanations. It is one of the best
ways to gain intuition about a particular data set, and can reveal patterns
that are hard to detect using automatic means.

The second is what most people think of when considering data visualization.
Visualization is often used to make a concept more clear and tangible. It aims
to highlight just the important aspect of the data to tell a story or to explain
a phenomenon.

The third is newer and more relevant in the digital age. Data visualizations can
be eye-catching, and can convince readers to pay attention to a particular story.
This is why infographics have been so successful: visual design keeps readers
attention longer than ordinary text [citation]. 

Each of these three reasons for visualizing data will place different constraints
on what is considered a "good" visualization. For example, an explorative visual
will usually have fewer demands on the labeling of axes and legends than an
explanatory visual.
