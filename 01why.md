## Why Visualize?

Among many tasks made efficient by both computing power and digital display,
the production and consumption of data visualizations are probably one of the
last to come to mind.  Nevertheless, the growing ubiquity of visualizations
speaks to the enormous power in communicating complex information in graphical
form -- now that we are able to easily do so.

There are many reasons to visualize data. They typically fall under three categories:

- [Exploration](#explore): to explore an unfamiliar data set
- [Explanation](#explain): to explain main insights from a data set,
  to tell stories, to convince someone of something
- [Generating Interest](#attention): to cause someone to be interested in a topic

The first is typically done by data analyst, data scientists, or others who work
with data in order to produce insights or explanations. It is one of the best
ways to gain intuition about a particular data set, and can reveal patterns
that are hard to detect using automatic means.

The second is what most people think of when considering data visualization.
Visualization is often used to make a concept more clear and tangible. It aims
to highlight just the important aspect of the data to tell a story or to explain
a phenomenon.

The third is newer and more relevant in the digital age. Data visualizations can
be eye-catching, and can convince readers to pay attention to a particular story.
This is why infographics have been so successful: visual design keeps readers
attention longer than ordinary text [citation]. 

Each of these three reasons for visualizing data will place different constraints
on what is considered a "good" visualization. For example, an explorative visual
will usually have fewer demands on the labeling of axes and legends than an
explanatory visual.
