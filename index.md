## Welcome

This is a short book on data visualization. It is designed for both creators
and consumers of data graphics to understand not only the best practises, but
also the biological motivating factors behind those best practises. Aside
from a small amount of biology, technical details are kept to a minimum.

Astute readers may recognize the many ideas that this book borrows from Wilkinson's
"The Grammar of Graphics". Also, using biological motivations to explain
best practises was a method from Ware's "Information Visualization", though
Ware's formalism is not duplicated here. Finally,
it is impossible not to be influenced by the many works of Hadley Wickham,
including both ggplot2 (which many graphics shown will be rendered in), and the
concept of "Tidy" data.

## Chapter Summaries

Below are short summaries for each chapter. Along with a link to the
chatper content if that chapter has been written.

#### Chapter 1: [Why Visualize?](/01why.html)

This chapter explores with examples three main reasons for
visualizing data: for exploring data,
for explanation and persuasion, and for gaining interest in the data.

#### Chapter 2: Data

We talk about the types of data, and the differences between
discrete vs continuous, ordinal vs nominal, ratio vs interval. 
We also discuss the concept of "tidy" data, and the difference between
patterns between attributes and patterns between units.

#### Chapter 3: Human Visual System

The eye and visual pathways in the brain is what we use to process
visualizations. This chapter dicusses the ways in which these systems
function, and what it means for visualization creators. Specifically, we
discover visual features that are "pre-attentive" that are great candidates
for encoding meaning.

#### Chapter 4: Encoding

Continuing with the ideas in the previous chapter, we discuss some of the
visual features that are candiates for encoding data. We dicsuss both the
benefits and limitations of each visual feature. We also discuss the concept
of "scaling" and also discuss common patterns.

#### Chapter 5: Common Charts

We use the language of encoding and explore some common charts that readers
are likely familiar with: starting with the line chart, bar chart, and pie
chart. Each has its own benefits and shortcomings, uses and misuses.


#### Chapter 6: Chart Choices

The choice of chart (or encoding) can highlight different items.
