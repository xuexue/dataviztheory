<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>
  This is a short book on data visualization. It is designed for both creators
  and consumers of data graphics to understand not only the best practises, but
  also the biological motivating factors behind those best practises. Aside
  from a small amount of biology, technical details are kept to a minimum.
</p>
<p>
  Astute readers may recognize the many ideas that this book borrows from Wilkinson's
  "The Grammar of Graphics". Also, using biological motivations to explain
  best practises was a method from Ware's "Information Visualization", though
  Ware's formalism is not duplicated here. Finally,
  it is impossible not to be influenced by the many works of Hadley Wickham,
  including both ggplot2 (which many graphics shown will be rendered in), and the
  concept of "Tidy" data.

<h2>Chapter Summaries</h2>

<p>
  Below are short summaries for each chapter. Along with a link to the
  chatper content if that chapter has been written.
</p>

<h4><a href="#">Chapter 1: Why Visualize?</a></h4>
<p>
  This chapter explores with examples three main reasons for
  visualizing data: for exploring data,
  for explanation and persuasion, and for gaining interest in the data.
</p>

<h4><a href="#">Chapter 2: Data</a></h4>
<p>
  We talk about the types of data, and the differences between
  discrete vs continuous, ordinal vs nominal, ratio vs interval. 
  We also discuss the concept of "tidy" data, and the difference between
  patterns between attributes and patterns between units.
</p>

<h4><a href="#">Chapter 3: Human Visual System</a></h4>
<p>
  The eye and visual pathways in the brain is what we use to process
  visualizations. This chapter dicusses the ways in which these systems
  function, and what it means for visualization creators. Specifically, we
  discover visual features that are "pre-attentive" that are great candidates
  for encoding meaning.
</p>

<h4><a href="#">Chapter 4: Encoding</a></h4>
<p>
  Continuing with the ideas in the previous chapter, we discuss some of the
  visual features that are candiates for encoding data. We dicsuss both the
  benefits and limitations of each visual feature. We also discuss the concept
  of "scaling" and also discuss common patterns.
</p>

<h4><a href="#">Chapter 5: Common Charts</a></h4>
<p>
  We use the language of encoding and explore some common charts that readers
  are likely familiar with: starting with the line chart, bar chart, and pie
  chart. Each has its own benefits and shortcomings, uses and misuses.
</p>

<h4><a href="#">Chapter 6: Chart Choices</a></h4>
  The choice of chart (or encoding) can highlight different items.
